## Container-based microservices with AWS, Weave and Shippable


### Goal
In this scenario, you'll set up and run the containerized Sock Shop
eCommerce application, with fully automated deployments, in 30
minutes or less.

Your sample application will feature:

  * **Amazon ECS**{: style="color: orange"} for container orchestration
  * **Amazon ECR**{: style="color: orange"} for container registry
  * **Weave Scope**{: style="color: orange"} for service discovery and container visualization
  * **Shippable**{: style="color: orange"} for automated CI/CD

This page provides the instructions necessary to:  

  * Provision a Weave-enabled Amazon ECS cluster using Cloud Formations and
  deploy all components of the Sock Shop microservices demo application except
  the <a href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end" style="color: orange">front-end</a>
   component
  * Configure a CI/CD pipeline to manage deployment of the
  <a href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end" style="color: orange">
  front-end</a> service using Shippable

---

### Fork and clone the repos
To get started, you'll need to fork and clone two GitHub repos.

1. Fork the [microservices-demo](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo){: style="color: orange"}
GitHub repo to your personal [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home){: style="color: orange"}

2. <p>Clone your fork locally on your machine</p>  
  * Click the green `Clone or download` button
  * Copy the URL for your forked repo that appears
  * Open a command line on your local machine and execute the command:
      <pre>$ git clone <i>your_forked_url</i></pre>

{:start="3"}
3. <p>Repeat steps 1-3 for the <a href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end"
style="color: orange">
front-end</a> repo

---

### Provision Amazon ECS cluster
Now, you'll provision a Weave-enabled Amazon ECS cluster and deploy all services
except for the front-end service.

1. Log into [Amazon Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home){: style="color: orange"}

2. Navigate to [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation){: style="color: orange"}

3. Select `Create Stack`

4. Under `Choose a template`, select `Choose file` or `Browse`

5. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the <span style="color: orange">
microservices-demo</span> repo
and choose to upload the file `./deploy/aws-ecs-shippable/cloudformation.json`

6. <p>Complete the form fields with the following values and select `Next`</p>
  * Stack name: `ecs-weave-shippable-demo`
  * DeployExampleApp: `Yes`
  * EcsInstanceType: `t2.medium`
  * KeyName: `choose an existing key pair or leave blank to create a new one`
  * Scale: `4`
  * WeaveCloudServiceToken: `leave blank`

{:start="7"}
7. Leave all form fields on the `Options` page as-is and select `Next`  

8. Click the `'I acknowledge ...'` boxes at bottom and select `Create`

**CloudFormation**{: style="color: orange"} will now create the entire stack
necessary to run your eCommerce demo app on Amazon ECS. This will several
minutes to complete and it will provision compute on AWS.

When your stack creation finishes with `CREATE_COMPLETE`, you'll find values of
AWS resources needed for the CI/CD pipeline setup available on the `Outputs` tab.
Take note of the following values:
  * TargetGroupARNTest
  * TargetGroupARNProd
  * TestALB
  * ProdALB  

---

### Configure an automated CI/CD pipeline

Your Weave-enabled Amazon ECS cluster should now be running 15 out of the 16 services
of the Sock Shop application (verify this by navigating to [EC2 Container Service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/clusters/ecs-weave-shippable-demo/services)).
We'll use Shippable to set up an automated CI/CD pipeline to deploy the
<a href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end" style="color: orange">
front-end</a> service.

1. Create a <a href="https://www.shippable.com" style="color: orange">Shippable</a>
account (if you don't already have one) by logging in with your
GitHub credentials

2. <p>Enable the <span style="color: orange">front-end</span> repo for <span style="color: orange">
CI</span> in Shippable</p>
    * In your local copy of the `front-end` repo, youâ€™ll need to update the `GROUP`
    environment variable in the shippable.yml configuration file with your values
    from your AWS environment (i.e. your Account ID and Region):
    * Replace the Amazon ECR registry URL with the URL for your Container registry,
    e.g. `288971733297.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/front-end` (you can copy/paste
      this URL by selecting `View Push Commands` on <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/repositories/front-end#images;tagStatus=ALL" style="color: orange">this page</a>)
      <pre>
      env:
        global:
          - GROUP=288971733297.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      </pre>

    * If you deployed your cluster to another region besides `us-east-1`, also
    update the `region` value accordingly:
      <pre>
      integrations:
        hub:
          - integrationName: shippable-ecr  # must match Subscription Integration in Shippable
            type: ecr
            region: us-east-1
      </pre>

    * Commit and push your changes to Github
      <pre>
      $ git commit -am 'update shippable.yml with my AWS details'
      $ git push origin master
      </pre>
    * Select your Subscription from the drop-down menu (three horizontal lines)
    in upper left
    * Select `Enable project` in left-hand nav
    * Find the `front-end` repo in the list and select `Enable`
    * Verify that your `front-end` project has been enabled:
    ![front-end-enable](/assets/img/shippable-pipeline-2.png){:width="600px"}

{:start="3"}
3. <p>Create the <span style="color: orange">front-end CD pipeline</span></p>
In your local copy of the microservices-demo repo, you'll need to update
the `shippable.resource.yml` configuration file with values from your AWS
environment:
    * Resource `img-front-end`

      <pre>
      # Docker image information
        - name: img-front-end
          type: image
          pointer:
            sourceName: 288971733297.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/front-end
            isPull: false
          seed:
            versionName: master.1
      </pre>
      * Replace the Amazon ECR registry URL with the URL for your Container
      registry,  e.g. `288971733297.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/front-end`
      * You can copy/paste this URL by selecting `View Push Commands` on
      <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/repositories/front-end#images;tagStatus=ALL" style="color: orange">
      this page</a> or finding the value for `EcrRepo` in your CloudFormation Outputs
      <p></p>
    * Resource `alb-front-end-test`

      <pre>
      # AWS ALB target group for TEST environment
        - name: alb-front-end-test     #required
          type: loadBalancer      #required
          pointer:
            sourceName: "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:288971733297:targetgroup/frontendTESTTG/102776f0c4a71605"
            method: application
      </pre>
      * Replace the value for `sourceName` to be the ARN for your Target Group
      named `frontendTESTTG`
      * You can find this in <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#TargetGroups:" style="color: orange">EC2-Target Groups</a>
      or in the value for `TargetGroupARNTest` in your CloudFormation Outputs
      <p></p>
    * Resource `alb-front-end-prod`

      <pre>
      # AWS ALB target group for PROD environment
        - name: alb-front-end-prod     #required
          type: loadBalancer      #required
          pointer:
            sourceName: "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:288971733297:targetgroup/frontendPRODTG/1a91e8d308e7f76e"
            method: application
      </pre>
      * Replace the value for `sourceName` to be the ARN for your Target Group
      named `frontendPRODTG`
      * You can find this in <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#TargetGroups:" style="color: orange">EC2-Target Groups</a>
      or in the value for `TargetGroupARNProd` in your CloudFormation Outputs
      <p></p>

    If you're running your cluster in a region other than `us-east-1`:
    * Resource `cluster-demo-ecs`

      <pre>
      # AWS cluster information
        - name: cluster-demo-ecs
          type: cluster
          integration: shippable-aws
          pointer:
            sourceName : "ecs-weave-shippable-demo"
            region: "us-east-1"
      </pre>
      * Replace the value for `region` to be the AWS region where you're running
      your cluster
      <p></p>

    Now, load your Pipeline configuration files into Shippable:
    
    * Select the `Pipelines` tab, `Resources` view, and then `Add Resource`
    button (far right)
    * In the Subscription Integrations dropdown: choose `Add integration` and
    complete the fields, as follows:
