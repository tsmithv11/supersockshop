<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Sock Shop microservices are designed to have minimal expectations, using DNS to find other services.
  This means that it is possible to insert load-balancers and service routers, as required or desired.
</p>
<p>
  There are pre-built configuration scripts for various platforms that aim to make running the whole application simple.
</p>
<p>
  Sock Shop can be used to illustrate microservices architectures, demonstrate platforms at talks and meetups, or as a training and education tool.

  Please let us know how you use it!
