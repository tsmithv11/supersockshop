# Deployment Configurations

This directory was previously part of https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo, the content here is outdated. 

Sub directories contain scripts and configuration for deployment of the microservices demo in target platforms. Please see the repository listing for an up to date list of deployments.

The intention was to also support the following, but have been held up by technical issues:

- Mesosphere DC/OS (no support in DCOS universe for multi-container packages)
- Docker Swarmkit (see [the swarmkit readme](./swarmkit/README.md))
- Docker Cloud (does not suit our use case)
